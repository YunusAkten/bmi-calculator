      <p>
        Body mass index (BMI) is a person’s weight in kilograms divided by the
        square of height in meters. BMI is an inexpensive and easy screening
        method for weight category—underweight, healthy weight, overweight, and
        obesity. BMI does not measure body fat directly, but BMI is moderately
        correlated with more direct measures of body fat . Furthermore, BMI
        appears to be as strongly correlated with various metabolic and disease
        outcome as are these more direct measures of body fatness .
